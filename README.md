🚗 Audi Car Price Prediction (Collaborative ML Project)
👥 Team Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive Machine Learning pipeline developed as a team effort to solve complex data problems. The project covers three major ML areas: Regression, Clustering, and Classification.

🛠️ My Role: Regression Specialist
While this was a team collaboration, I took full ownership of the Regression phase. I developed the end-to-end predictive engine for car prices using the Audi dataset.

My Key Contributions:

End-to-End Regression Workflow: I handled everything from initial data loading to final model evaluation for the audi.csv dataset.

Advanced Data Cleaning: I implemented outlier removal using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method to ensure model stability.

Feature Engineering: I analyzed key factors like mileage, engineSize, and year to optimize price predictions.

Model Benchmarking: I trained and compared multiple models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
